## Technical challenges we anticipated
- why, what was the plan to overcome those challenges?
- what did you learn?
- Allowing users to chat instantly - we planned to use web sockets to render messages in real time, while also saving them to the database for users to access during later correspondence
- Authenticating users - our team discussed using Passport.js for login authentication and hashing passwords before storing on the server to secure user information


## Unexpected challenges
- why was it a challenge

## How does the app work?
- What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it?
- OR What are all the places the data travels?  What happens to that data?
- Optionally include a diagram
- How does the tech stack come together?

## What research was required?

## Workflow and key lessons
- Your git workflow, style guides, commit guides, etc
- What did you learn from the process
- What were key takeaways from stand ups, code reviews, etc
- Writing tests
- Link to your trello board, discuss completed tickets
